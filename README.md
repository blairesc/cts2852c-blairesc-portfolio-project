A portfolio web site with at least five (5) pages.

Create a portfolio web site with at least five (5) pages. The web site must have the following pages: 

Home 
The first time the home page is visited, prompt the user for their name. Display the user name entered with an appropriate welcome message on the home page. Store the name entered in a cookie. When the user revisits the page, do not prompt for the user name. Instead, obtain the name from the stored cookie before displaying the name with an appropriate welcome message on the home page. Include in the welcome message, the number of times the user has visited the home page. Use index.html as the filename for the Home page. 

Gallery
On the gallery page, include a JavaScript driven photo gallery with at least five (5) images of original work (web pages screen shots, photographs, illustrations, etc) that you have created. The photo gallery must have previous and next buttons to change the image being displayed. Images must wrap to the first image when the next button is clicked while the last image is being displayed. Similarly, images must wrap to the last image when the previous button is clicked while the first image is being displayed. The next image must be displayed after five (5) seconds if the user has not clicked the next button. Use gallery.html as the filename for the Gallery page. 

About Me 
Include an image of yourself on the About Me page. When the mouse rolls over the image, display a different image of yourself. Include the following information about yourself: Services (at least three) you provide. How you obtained the skills to provide the services mentioned. How long you have been providing the services. Use aboutme.html as the filename for the About Me page. 

Contact Me 
Include a form on the Contact Me page that prompts for and validates: 

First and last name 
An email address (validate using a regular expression)
A date using a JavaScript pop-up calendar (jQuery can be used)
A password with a JavaScript password strength meter (See Password Tips for more information) 
A comments box that limits input to 500 characters with a running count of characters input 

Use http://ss1.ciwcertified.com/cgi-bin/process.pl as the action for the form and include the novalidate attribute in the <form> tag . 
  
Use contactme.html as the filename for the Contact Me page. 

A page of your own choice 
  
Use a feature of JavaScript that is not a requirement for this project to showcase your knowledge of JavaScript. 
  
Use mypage.html as the filename for the page. 
  
The top-level navigation of the site must be generated using a multi-dimensional JavaScript array that is stored in an external file which is linked to each page of the portfolio web site. When generating the top-level navigation, the current page of the portfolio site that is being viewed must be displayed without a hyperlink. All other pages in the top-level navigation must be hyperlinked to the appropriate web page.
